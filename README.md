Dear Tshingombe, 

Thank you for your email. 

Please note that our office has received 11 emails in 5 calendar days and it is not clear from all emails what is needed. 

An official transcript is a full record of your academic activities at the University. It is produced by the Student Records Office only and contains the stamp and the signature of an authorised University official to ensure authenticity of the document. The official transcript is confidential and only issued upon request and authorization of the student using the instructions below: 

 

STEP ONE: DOWNLOAD AND COMPLETE THE ACADEMIC TRANSCRIPT REQUEST FORM 

The form can be downloaded from our website: 
http://www.students.uct.ac.za/students/current-students/student-records/academic-records  

  

Click on Official Transcripts and under the Downloads section on the right-hand side, the request form can be accessed.  

  

STEP TWO: MAKE THE PAYMENT 

The Treasury Office within UCT Finance has taken the precautionary measure to close the cash office until further notice. Please select one payment method to the Student Records Office as follows: 

 

STUDENT RECORDS OFFICE BANKING DETAILS 

Bank:                       Standard Bank 

Account Name:     University of Cape Town (can be added as a Public Recipient) 

Account Number: 071503854 (Current) If available, select the Sundries Account 

Branch Code:         025009  

 

PLEASE INCLUDE THE REFERENCE NUMBER: 11195/Initials & Surname or UCT student number (e.g., 11195/AB Jones) 

 

1.      METHOD ONE: ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER (EFT) 

Please use the banking details above and send proof of payment to yourself as an emailed notification and download the PDF to your device. 

 

2.      METHOD TWO: ONLINE PAYMENT GATEWAY 

If you would like to pay via credit card (American Express, MasterCard or Visa only), please click the link for instructions to make an online payment: https://uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/media/documents/SRO_CARD_PAYMENT.pdf  

 

3.      METHOD THREE: (FOR INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS ONLY) WIRE TRANSFER 

Where payment is being made from outside the rand currency area, payment can be made by telegraphic transfer into the Student Records Office bank account (see details above). The Swift code is SBZA ZAJJ. 

  





STEP THREE: EMAIL THE COMPLETED REQUEST FORM AND PROOF OF PAYMENT 

Please attach the request form and confirmation of payment as a PDF document and email it to transcripts@uct.ac.za 

  

Requests will be processed within 4 working days and courier delivery will be made in 2-5 working days thereafter (depending on location). 

  

 

PLEASE NOTE 

    Once your request has been received and if you have paid for courier delivery, our office will send you with a Google form link to confirm the courier delivery details (contact person, contact number and physical address). If you have not received the tracking number from the courier company within a week of completing the Google form, please follow up by email.  
    Transcripts requested for delivery to World Education Services must include a clear scanned copy of your hard copy degree certificate/s and WES form/s so that we can adhere to WES requirements. We are able to submit your documents electronically. 
    The Records Office does not offer a secure file transfer delivery method, your transcript can be emailed directly to an institution. Please include the institution’s email address and necessary reference number if available. 
    Records are not issued to currently registered students until examination results are finalised by the FEC/SEC. 
    Transcripts will not be issued to students or alumni who owe outstanding fees for past or current studies or those with open disciplinary cases against them. Please send our office an email for more information.  

 

To speak to a consultant in the Student Records Office, please contact us on +2721 650 3595 should you need any further information or assistance.

Regards,

Nicole Forbes

Records Assistant
